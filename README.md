# Scripts to extract Kindle clippings

All scripts need the clippings file (usually named 'My Clippings.txt') and a
expression to search, for example, the book name.

## Shell script

Use the `kindleclipping.sh` script:

```
$ ./kindleclipping.sh <clippings file> <expression>
```

## Ruby script

This is an updated version of the shell script.
Use the `kindleclipping.rb` script:

```
$ ruby kindleclipping.rb <clippings file> <expression>
```
